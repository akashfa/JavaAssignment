                 Assignment question And Answer
1 What is encapsulation in java why it is called data hiding 
  encapsulation is a fundamental concept object oriented programming that combine data and 
  method that operate data into within in class
 Data Hiding
 Achieved through encapsulation decelerated  variable member as private 
 we can access and modify  variable outside the class with the help of setter and getter method 
2 What are the imported features of encapsulation
  a. Data hiding  
     Achieved through encapsulation making the variable as private 
  b. Controlled Access 
     we can access and modify the data help of the setter and getter method outside the class 
  c. Abstraction 
     encapsulation promotes abstraction by hiding internal details of a class user only interact public method 
3 What are the getter and setter method in java explain with an example
  . getter method 
    we can assess the data outside  another class this method will be public 
  . setter method 
    We can modify the data with help of the setter method
  
class Test{
private String name;
private int age;
public String getName() {
   return name;
}
public void setName(String name) {
   this.name = name;
}
public int getAge() {
   return age;
}
public void setAge(int age) {
   this.age = age;
}
}
public class Example { 
public static void main(String[] args) {
  
  Test t1=new Test();
  t1.setName("Akash Shram");
  t1.setAge(19);
  System.out.println(t1.getName());
  System.out.println(t1.getAge());
 
   
    }
 }
4 what is the use of this keyword explain with an example 
  this keywords is reserved word use for the reference of the current object 
  class Car {
    private String color;

    public void paint(String newColor) {
        this.color = newColor; // 'this' refers to the current Car object
        System.out.println("Car painted " + this.color);
    }
}
5 What is the advantage of the encapsulation  
  .increased code size 
  .potential service overhead 
  .increased development time 
  .debuggability
6 How to achieve encapsulation in java given an example 
  create class inside the class making instance variable private and create setter and getter method public 
  
class Test{
private String name;
private int age;
public String getName() {
   return name;
}
public void setName(String name) {
   this.name = name;
}
public int getAge() {
   return age;
}
public void setAge(int age) {
   this.age = age;
}
}
public class Example { 
public static void main(String[] args) {
  
  Test t1=new Test();
  t1.setName("Akash Shram");
  t1.setAge(19);
  System.out.println(t1.getName());
  System.out.println(t1.getAge());
 
   
    }
 }
