     Exception Handling Assignment Questions

 1.Explain different types of Errors in Java.
 Errors are serious issues that occur in the JVM, often beyond the programmers control like StackOverflowError, OutOfMemoryError,  or    VirtualMachineError.

2. What is an Exception in Java?
 An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow. It can be caught and handled to avoid crashing the program.

3.How can you handle exceptions in Java? Explain with an example
    Exceptions are handled using try, catch, and finally blocks  
    Example:
    
     try {
         int result = 10 / 0;
     } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
         System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
     } finally {
         System.out.println("This will always execute");
     }
     

 4. Why do we need exception handling in Java?
   Exception handling ensures that the program can handle runtime errors gracefully preventing abrupt termination and allowing recovery or alternative actions.

5. What is the difference between an exception and an error in Java?
   Exceptions are recoverable issues related to program logic while Errors are serious system level problems that cannot be easily handled or recovered from like hardware failures or JVM issues

 6. Name the different types of exceptions in Java
    Exceptions are divided into
     Checked Exceptions e.g IOException, SQLException.
     Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime): e.g NullPointerException, ArithmeticException.

7.Can we just use try instead of finally and catch blocks?
    No a try block must be followed by either a catch block a finally block or both. You cannot use try alone
