Que1      What are Primitive Data Types in Java
                    These are primitive data type byte short int,long,float,double,char boolean in java
                        
Que2      What are Identifiers in java
                     Identifier in java anything which can you use for identification They can be class name 
                     Variables name method name label name and many more There are some reserved
                     Words that can not use like identifiers
                    
Que3      What is final class in java
                     If class is marked final that class can not participating inheritance it would not inheritable  
                     Child class 


Que4      What are two ways to make a class final
                     Frist way to make class final if applied the final at class that class will become final 
                     Another way if applied private at constructor  the class will become final


Que5      Can we create an instance of final class in another class
                    Yes we create an instance of final class in another class but can not be inheritable child 
                     Class


Que6      What is volatile keyword used for
                      Volatile keyword used for only one thread should access the variable value 


Que7     What is the use of transient keyword 
                    If applied transient keyword at data that data can not serialised


Que8     What are the types of casting 
                   i. Primitive type casting  
                     When the data is cast  form primitive type first data should be primitive data type and      
                      second data should be also primitive data type it is called primitive type casting      
                    ii.Drive type casting
                   One data is cast from drive data and another data should be drive data it is called drive 
                       Type casting
                        
Que9    What is boxing and unboxing
                   Converting primitive type of variable into object is referred as boxing 
                   Converting object into primitive type of variable is referred as unboxing


Que10  What are the different between keyword identifier and literals
              Identifier which can you use for identification they can be class name variable
                 Name method name and more
                  Keyword are the reserved word that have pre define meaning for the compiler
                Literals are the value asinine the identifier
