             Assignment Question And Answer
1 What is the constructors 
  Constructor is special type method this methos automatically call whenever crating an object of a class
  this method no return type and Assigning initial value of object Attribute(variables)
  name of the constructor always same name of the class\
2 What is constructor chaining
  Constructor is powerful technique that provide code reusability one constructor call another constructor
  that is called constructor chaining
  you can use this() keyword calling the another constructor within the same class
  you can use super() keyword calling the parent constructor 
3 Can we call a subclass constructor from a superclass constructor 
  because at the time of  object correction  first superclass constructer call and you can use 
  this key word this represent current object so we can not call subclass constructor from a superclass constructor
4 What is happened if you keep a return type for a constructor 
  if you keep a return type for a constructor you get Compile time error because constructer 
  never allow return type of a constructor 
5 What is no-arg constructor 
  you can define own  no argument constructor with help of class name this constructor perform specific 
  initialization task for the object 
6 How is no argument constructor difference from the default constructor
  compiler automatically provide default constructor for a class
  No argument constructor explicitly crate with help of the class name 
7 When do we need constructor overloading 
  we need constructor overloading whenever you want creating object with the same name of class different way  
  you create no argument constructor useful for creating an object with default value 
  you create argument constructor useful for creating an object with argument value
8 What is default constructor Explain with an example
  whenever we are not creating own constructor then  compiler automatically provide default constructer for a class
  class Person {
  private String name;
  private int age;
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person person1 = new Person(); // Uses the default constructor
    System.out.println("Name: " + person1.name); // Might print null (default for String)
    System.out.println("Age: " + person1.age); // Might print 0 (default for int)
  }
}
