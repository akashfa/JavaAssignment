Assignment Question answer 

1 What is conditional operator in java
Conditional operator are two type
i. Logical operator 
   logical (&&) operator-> if applying the logical operator make sure both operands condition true then logical operator will be
   work if first operands condition false then logical and operator body will not executed 
ii. Ternary Operator 
   this operator take three operands (condition)?(expression_if_true):(expression_if_false); 
   if condition is true then expression_if_true operands executed if condation is false the expression_if_false operands executed 

2 What are the type of operators based on number of operands 
  a. Unary Operators 
     i.increment  ii.decrement 
  b Ternary Operators 
  c compression operators ==,<,>,>=,<=,!=
  d Arithmetic Operators  +,-,*,/,%
  e logical    operators  &&,||
  f Assignment operators =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=

3 What is use of Switch case in java programming 
  you are using multiple time if  else statement this is not  right approach then go to the switch case statement 
  
4 What are priority level of Arithmetic operators in java
 i.Multiplication (*) Division (/) modules (%) these are give operators all the same priority these operators executed left to
 right 
 Ex 2*3+6 -> (2*3)+6-> 6+6=12
Additions (+) Subtraction (-) These are operators also same priority  left to right
Ex-> 10-2*3 ->10-6=4

5 What are the condition statement and use of conditional statement in java
 a. if statement _>this base statement if condition is true then body executed 
 b  if-else statement -> this is extends of if statement this is provide alternative body 
    if condition is false then else block body will be executes 
 c  else-if statement -> this statement provide multiple condition if condition is false then check else-if this is condition is true body
    executes 
d   Switch case Statement 
    this statement use multiple way one variable hold different type of data  according this variable executes the block of code
6 What is the syntax of if else statement
   if(condition){
      //body
   }else{
       //body
     }
7 What are the three type iteration statement in java
  a. for loop
    fist initialization then condition checking then increment /decrement 
    according this for loop body executed 
 b. while loop in this loop before condition checking then body executes 
 c. do-while loop in this first body executes after condition checking 

8 What are the difference between for loop and do-while loop
   a  for loop
    fist initialization then condition checking then increment /decrement 
    according this for loop body executed 
  c. do-while loop in this first body executes after condition checking 
9 write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10

   class Aks{
      public static void main(String[]args){
          for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
          System.out.println(i);
         }
       }
     }
