      method
      if mark the method static without objecte creating call method
      final

      class 
      yes we can mark class as final if we mark final then class would not participate in inheritance
      fields
      yes we can marka fields as final if we mark then those variables are called as
      complierTimeConstant
      method
       yes we can mark method as final but we can not overriden method
