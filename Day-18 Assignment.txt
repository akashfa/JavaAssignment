                Assignment Question And Answer
1 What is need static keyword in java with example
  Static keyword use different purpose basically use for memory management and code organization 
  a. static variables
     if we are creating variable using static keywords that is called static variable
     creating single instance shared by all object of the class we can asses variable using 
     instance of the class
  b. static method 
     if mark method the static we do not need creating an object directly call using only method name
     inside the method we can asses other static members 
  c. static block 
     before creating an object executes static block of code 
  d. static Nested class
     if apply the static keyword inner class we do not need creating an object outer class only creating
     object inner class and asses all method and variable inside method
  class OuterClass {
  static class InnerClass {
    public void printMessage() {
      System.out.println("Inner Class Message");
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    OuterClass.InnerClass inner = new InnerClass();
    inner.printMessage();
  }
}
2 What is the class loading and how java program executed 
  Class loading  
  when you run java program jvm load all necessary class demand using the loading class mechanism.
  java program execution 
  java source code-----> compile->>>>>>>>>.class file(byte code)---------->>>jvm-------class loading----------> execution 
3 you can mark a local variable as static 
  we can not mark local variable as static variable because locale variable scope method and block  level these variable are stored 
 tamp data
4 why static block executed before main method in java
  at the time of class loading jvm  load all necessary  class find and loading linking which required to our program for run so 
  before main method execution static block executed
5 Why is static method also called  a class method
  Static and class method both do not need to creating an object 
6 Difference between static and instance variable 
  Feature	Static Variable	                         Instance Variable
  Declaration	static int count;	                  int number;
  Scope	        Shared by all objects	                  Specific to each object
  Lifetime	Exists throughout program execution	  Exists as long as the object exists
  Access  	ClassName.count	                           objectName.number
7 Difference between static and non static members 
  Feature	Static members	                          non static members 
  Declaration	static int count;	                  int number;
  Scope	        Shared by all objects	                  Specific to each object
  Lifetime	Exists throughout program execution	  Exists as long as the object exists
  Access  	ClassName.count	                           objectName.number
  Memory  Allocation	Allocated once during class loading	Allocated for each object instance
  Usage	                Utility functions, constants	        Object-specific data, behavior
