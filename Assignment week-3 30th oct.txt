Ques1 what is difference between JVM JRE and JDK
      
      JVM ( java virtual machine)
      jvm give the instruction for computer to run the java programe
      that is responsive bytecode change to machine level code
      JRE(java runtime environment)
      JRE include jvm along with library and other requriment for java
      Application
      JDK contains JRE as well as tool requriment for  creating java Application 

Ques2 How is java programming language machine and platfrom independent
      it is language compile time generation of byte code so java is platfrom 
      independent

Ques3 Explain how java code executed by the jvm 
      interpeter one by one line code read
      JIT complier keep  trak the statement exection program that change the 
      machine code to send for cpu thus jvm exectued code
      performance would be high because of jit complier

Ques4 What is use of var-args 
     var-args of use different diffrente argument pass the same method name var-args
     accepte all
      class Aks{
       public static void add(int... a){
         int sum=0;
         for(int b:a){
            sum+=b;
         }
        System.out.println(sum);
 
       public static void main(String[]args){  
         
         add()
         add(10,30)
         add(30,40,50,60);

       }
}

Ques5 What are the types of variable in java
      1. depending upon position and declaration of variable
       local variable
       ++++++++++++++
       local variable is create inside the method
       scope:: inside the method and memory will be delocated once come out
       the method 
       instance variable
       ++++++++++++++++
       instance variable is create inside the class are called instance
       scope::object ot object and memory will be give  creation object
       static variable
       ++++++++++++++
       which variable create using static keyword inside the class are called
       static variable 
       scope::comman every object and memory will be give .class loading time for
       static variable
      2. depending upon type of value hold by variable
         primitive variable
         int d=10;
         reference variable
         String str=new String("Akash Sharma);

Ques6 How many type of memory areas allocated by JVM 
     a. Method Area
     b. Heap Area
     c. Stack Area
     d. Pc Register


Ques7 What is Just-in-Time complier in java(JIT)
      JIT complier keep  trak the statement exection program that change the 
      machine code to send for cpu performance would be high because of jit complier
